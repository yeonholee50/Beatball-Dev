# PlatformGame

Welcome to our PlatformGame, originally developed for an assignment but later enhanced with additional features to provide an engaging and competitive gaming experience. 

## Overview

Our PlatformGame is reminiscent of the classic GameBoy era, offering a nostalgic yet exciting gameplay experience. Players navigate a character through various levels, overcoming obstacles and enemies to reach the end goal. What sets our game apart is the incorporation of a scoring system, adding depth and competitiveness to the gameplay.

## Features

### Score Tracking
We've implemented a robust scoring system that keeps track of each player's progress throughout the game. Whether you're aiming for a personal best or competing against friends, our game ensures that your achievements are duly noted and celebrated.

### Database Integration
In the latest version of our game, we've integrated a database system to store the scores of the top players. This feature adds a layer of persistence, allowing players to immortalize their triumphs and compete for the coveted title of highest scorer.

### Random Bounce Trajectory
To inject an element of unpredictability and challenge, we've introduced a random bounce trajectory mechanic. This feature adds a dynamic element to the gameplay, ensuring that each playthrough is unique and keeps players on their toes. Despite its challenging nature, the game remains fair and winnable, providing a satisfying balance between difficulty and enjoyment.

### Infinite Time
Unlike traditional platform games with time constraints, our game offers infinite time to complete each level. This design choice encourages exploration and strategic gameplay, allowing players to fully immerse themselves in the game world without the pressure of a ticking clock.

## How to Play

1. Use the arrow keys to move your character left or right.
2. Press the space bar to jump and navigate through the levels.
3. Collect power-ups and bonuses to increase your score.
4. Avoid obstacles and enemies to progress through the game.
5. Reach the end goal to advance to the next level.
